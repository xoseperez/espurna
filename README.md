# ESPurna Firmware

ESPurna ("spark" in Catalan) is a custom firmware for ESP8285/ESP8266 based smart switches, lights and sensors.
It uses the Arduino Core for ESP8266 framework and a number of 3rd party libraries.

## Collaborators

Since November 2018, Max Prokhorov (@mcspr) is also actively working as a collaborator of the project. 

## Contributors

**Without your help this project would not be possible**. I (@xoseperez) simply can't spend all the time I wish on ESPurna but luckly I recieve a lot of contributions, bug fixes, enhancement suggestions,... from people all around the world. I would like to thank each and every one of you. The [contributors](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/graphs/contributors) page shows the ones that have done a PR in the past, but I also get contributions in the issues, by email or via the [gitter ESPurna channel](https://gitter.im/tinkerman-cat/espurna), those I also want to thank.

**Thank you all very much**.

## Notice

> Ladies and gentlemen in the embedded world, use [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). If I could offer you only one tip for the future, [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) would be it.

> Please use the [gitter ESPurna channel](https://gitter.im/tinkerman-cat/espurna) for support and questions, you have better chances to get fast answers from me or other ESPurna users. Open an issue here only if you feel there is a bug or you want to request an enhancement. Thank you.

> Please use [gitter](https://gitter.im/tinkerman-cat/espurna) for support and questions, you have better chances to get fast answers by me or other ESPurna users. Open an issue here only if you feel there is a bug or you want to request an enhancement. Thank you.

---
> **2018-03-09**<br />
> Default branch in GitHub is now the development branch "dev".<br>
> The stable branch (the one used to create the [binary releases](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/releases)) is "[master](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/tree/master)".

---
> **2018-01-24**<br />
> This repository has been migrated from Bitbucket to GitHub. There were a number of reason to migrate the repository to GitHub. I like Bitbucket and I'm still using it for a lot of projects, but ESPurna has grown and its community as well. Some users have complain about Bitbucket not being enough community-focused. This change is mainly aimed to use a platform with greater acceptance on the open-source community and tools better suited to them (to you), like the possibility to contribute to the documentation in an easy way.
>
>What happened with all the info in Bitbucket? Well, most of it has been ported to GitHub, albeit with some quirks:
>
>* **Code** has, of course been migrated completely
>* **Issues** are all on GitHub already **but** all issues and comments show up as reported by me. The original reporter is referenced inside the body of the issue (or comment) with a link to his/her profile at Bitbucket and a link to his/her profile at GitHub if it happens to be the same username. I **suggest all reporters to subscribe to the issues they originally filed** (search for your BitBucket username to list them).
>* **Pull requests** historic has not been migrated. At the moment of the migration all pull-requests have been either merged or declined. Of course, those PR merged are in the code base, but the historic and comments in the PR pages will be lost.
>* **Documentation** it's on it way, first step will be to migrate existing wiki, maybe with a new TOC structure
>* **Watchers**, **Forks**, I'm afraid they are all gone. Visit the new repo home and click on the "Watch" button on the top right. And as you do it click also on the "Star" button too :)
>
>I apologize for any inconvenience this migration may have caused. I have decided to do it the hard way.

---
> **2018-01-11**<br />
> As of current version (1.12.0) ESPurna is tested using Arduino Core 2.3.0 and it's meant to be built against that version.

---
> **2017-08-26**<br />
> Since version 1.9.0 the default **MQTT topics for commands have changed**. They all now end with "/set". This means you will have to change your controller software (Node-RED or alike) to send messages to -for instance- "/home/living/light/relay/0/set". The device will publish its state in "/home/living/light/relay/0" like before.

---
> **2017-07-24**<br />
> Default flash layout changed in 1.8.3, as an unpredicted consequence devices will not be able to persist/retrieve configuration if flashed with 1.8.3 via **OTA** from **PlatformIO**. Please check issue [#187](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/issues/187).

## Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to ESPurna development. You can contribute to the repository by doing:

* Pull requests (fixes, enhancements, new features... are very welcome)
* Documentation (I reckon I'm bad at it)
* Testing (filing issues or help resolving them, they take a lot of time and sometimes I don't have the required hardware to test them all)

And of course you can always buy me a beer, coffee, tea,... via the donation button below.
