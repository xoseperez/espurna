# ESPurna Support

If you're looking for support for ESPurna there are some options available:

* [Issues](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue): this is the most dinamic channel at the moment, you might find an answer to your question by searching current or closed issues.
* [Wiki pages](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/wiki): might not be as up-to-date as we all would like (hey, you can also contribute in the documentation!).
* [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/tinkerman-cat/espurna): you have better chances to get fast answers from me or other ESPurna users.
* [Issue a question](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/issues/new/choose): as a last resort, you can open new *question* issues on GitHub. Just remember: the more info you provide the more chances you'll have to get an accurate answer.
